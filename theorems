If A-B-C, then AB + BC = AC
The midpoint of a line segment divides it into segments half as long as the line segment
If ray OA-ray OB-ray OC, then the measure of angle AOB + the measure of angle BOC equals the measure of angle AOC
A ray that bisects and angle divides it into angles half as large as the angle
Complements of the same angle (or equal angles) are equal
Supplements of the same angle (or equal angles) are equal
If two angles are a linear pair, then they are supplementary
If the two angles in a linear pair are equal, then each is a right angle
If two angles are vertical angles, then they are equal
If two lines are perpendicular, they form four right angles
Any two right angles are equal
Two triangles congruent to a third triangle are congruent to each other
If two sides of a triangle are equal, the angles opposite them are equal
If a triangle is equilateral, it is also equiangular
If two angles of a triangle are equal, the sides opposite them are equal
If a triangle is equiangular, it is also equilateral
If the three sides of one triangle are equal to the three sides of another triangle, the triangles are congruent
In a plane, two points each equidistant from the endpoints of a line segment determine the perpendicular bisector of the line segment
An exterior angle of a triangle is greater than either remote interior angle
